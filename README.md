# File Instruction
Python files 
* Basic.py: Here are some basic functions used in this project.
* EKF.py: Here are 2 implementations of extended Kalman filter,  EKF_v1 and EKF_v2.
* Evaluation.py: The evaluation metric for this project is MSE.
* KF.py: Here are 3 Kalman filters.
* ML_estimator.py: There is an ML class containing 2 ML estimators.
* S_recovery.py: Unwrapping algorithm and sparse recovery.
* gene_tr.py: This is a file generating the trajectories and measurements.

There are three folders.
* Experiments: Experiment files.
* Experiments_data: Intermediate experiment data (trajectories etc.).
* Results: Results of the experiments.

# How to implement the experiments?
Create a `tests` folder under C disk (if using another path, please modify the `filepath` in each ipynb file of folder `Experiments`). Then run the ipynb files in folder `Experiments` on Jupyter notebook.
